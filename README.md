# Bank of America Merrill Lynch Infographic Challenge

## Practice data sets

Students have experience using `pandas` to calculate statistics, including correlation, and visualise distributions. This workshop explores some further techniques that go beyond the AS specification.

### Census data

The 2011 Census Microdata Teaching File is a 1% (500,000 row) sample drawn from the 2010 national census, provided by [ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census/2011censusdata/censusmicrodata/microdatateachingfile) for educational purposes.

Practice cross-tabulation with `pandas` `crosstab`, including normalisation. Use `seaborn` `heatmap` to visualise.

A smaller "Nanodata" file is provided which will be more responsive in low-memory contexts.

### Air quality data

Monthly air quality data.

Plotting time series. How to convince `pandas` to treat the first column as a date. How to rename columns to make selection easier. Better looking scatter plots with `seaborn`.
